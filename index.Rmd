# Structure {-}

This book intends to start with the some historical background and definition of terms (Chapter 1 - 4).
Then it introduces the ideas behind how we approach data (Chapter 4 - 8) and also spends some time with how to plan the analysis (Chapter 9 - 12).
Following this, the book introduces a set of run-of-the-mill statistical techniques to (Chapter 13 - 19).
The walkthrough ends with some acessible introduction to more advanced techniques (Chapter 20 - 24).

Each practical section will begin by describing a problem that we aim to solve by means of the technique we learn about.
