# Quantitative Research

> One of the many goals of quantitative methods is to make reliable conclusions from the observations you make. 

<br><br>

* Hypothesis: Given condition X, we will see people do Y. 
* Measurement: Make observations under condition X.
* **Test: Did we observe people do Y? (Today's focus)**

* Reproducibility Crisis

.pull-right[

#### Some Causes we can fix by changing how we do  and document our analysis

1. Misunderstanding of statistics
2. Low reproducibility (experiments, **analysis**)
3. Poor records
4. Not sharing data openly

# Why R?

* Free as in Freedom

> Costs Â£0.

* Documents your analysis

> Any conclusion people make from data should stand independent of the person making
> the conclusion.

* Open Source

> If you do the same tests on the same data, but get a different result, the
> difference must be about how the test was programmed.

* Data preprocessing

> 80% of time is spent on data preprocessing, see
> [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#5e7ed02f6f63).
> R is superb at preprocessing, saving a large amount of time - especially for
> multiple projects.

# The Analysis Pipeline

<br><br>

**The published paper is only a summary of what you have done, it is not the perfect
record of how you arrived at a certain statistical conclusion.**

Using R allows you to complement your paper. It will let you:

* records every analysis step.
* inspect the way the results are calculated.
* reproduce analysis and let others reproduce yours.

# What is going to happen today?

<br><br>

**Complete a worksheet**

* Start from importing the raw data for analysis
* End by having a single reliable conclusion about your data
