The book is designed to give you a rough overview on various techniques that we use to argue with data.

Then it introduces the ideas behind how we approach data (Chapter 4 - 8) and also spends some time with how to plan the analysis (Chapter 9 - 12). Following this, the book introduces a set of run-of-the-mill statistical techniques to (Chapter 13 - 19). The walkthrough ends with some acessible introduction to more advanced techniques (Chapter 20 - 24). Each practical section will begin by describing a problem that we aim to solve by means of the technique we learn about.

There are many radically different ways to acquire and analyse data. From the traditional, mainstream psychologist‚Äôs perspective, there is a well-tried formula on how you should go about it. Its goal is to test explanations of behaviour ‚Äî to narrow down the vast number of explanations you can build to explain human behaviour. If you are a behavioural scientist, a rudimentary and user-friendly scientific method might look like this: Hypothesis: Given condition X, we will see people do Y. Measurement: Make observations under condition X. Test: Did we observe people do Y? I would like to emphasize that this is a rudimentary, straightforward empirical test of a given explanation. It can be a powerful tool. Nonetheless, this is only one of the countless ways science can be carried out. 1.1 Hypothesis: Given condition X, we will see people do Y. 1.2 Measurement: Make observations under condition X. 1.3 Test: Did we observe people do Y? In order to do this, you are required to reliably conclude from the data (observations) you have. This is where statistics and R come in. While human reasoning is powerful, it is influenced by human biases, very limited cognitive capacity, and also by simple tiredness. It is actually very hard to evaluate evidence without pre-existing beliefs. Andy Wills: Science, Truth, Honesty slides notes course Todd Gureckis: Why do we learn statistics? video chapter.

The reason behind this is simple: repeated observations will increase our confidence that the effect is real. 2.1 Reproducibility Crisis Image was taken from Open Science Collaboration (2015) 2.2 Some causes we can fix by changing how we do and document our analysis Misunderstanding of statistics Low reproducibility (experiments, analysis) Poor records Not sharing data openly Andy Wills: Fix the replication Crisis video David Shanks: The replication crisis in psychology video David Shanks: Does social science tell the truth? video Priya Silverstein: Easing into open science video "],["open-science.html", "3 Open Science", " 3 Open Science "],["why-r.html", "4 Why R?", " 4 Why R?

Open Source If you do the same tests on the same data, but get a different result, the difference must be about how the authors programmed the test. Data preprocessing People roughly spend 80% of their time on data preprocessing, see article. R is superb at preprocessing, saving a large amount of time ‚Äî especially for multiple projects.
