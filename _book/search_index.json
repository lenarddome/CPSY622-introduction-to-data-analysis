Then it introduces the ideas behind how we approach data (Chapter 4 - 8) and also spends some time with how to plan the analysis (Chapter 9 - 12). Following this, the book introduces a set of run-of-the-mill statistical techniques to (Chapter 13 - 19). The walkthrough ends with some acessible introduction to more advanced techniques (Chapter 20 - 24). Each practical section will begin by describing a problem that we aim to solve by means of the technique we learn about.

There are many radically different ways to acquire and analyse data. From the traditional, mainstream psychology perspective, there is a well-tried formula on how you should go about it. Its goal is to test explanations of behaviour and cognition ‚Äî to narrow down the vast number of hypothesis you can build to explain human cognition and behaviour. If you are a behavioural scientist, a rudimentary and user-friendly scientific method might look like this: Hypothesis: Given condition X, we will see people do Y. Measurement: Make observations under condition X. Test: Did we observe people do Y? I would like to emphasize that this is a rudimentary, straightforward empirical test of a given explanation. It can be a powerful tool, but surprisingly ineffective. In an ideal scenario, you want at least two different and contradictory hypotheses. \\(H_1\\): Given condition X, we will see people do Y. \\(H_2\\): Given condition X, we will see people do Z. \\(H_3\\): Given‚Ä¶ \\(H_4\\): Given‚Ä¶ Hypotheses can be slightly different or directly contradicting each other. No matter how similar might be, distinguishing between these hypothesis allow us to infer often subtle ways a certain psychological process might operate. Nonetheless, this is only one of the countless ways science can be carried out. We will stick with the rudimentary version of our scientific method. 1.1 Hypothesis: Given condition X, we will see people do Y. Researchers conjure hypothesis after taking a set of assumptions about how humans work. That is to say, they look at the consequences of laws of behaviour and cognition1. Consider one such law established by Adam Smith: People make rational choices based on their self-interest. This idea is part of expected utility theory ‚Äî a normative approach to decision-making. One consequence of this law is that people will always pick the choice that will have the highest reward with the highest certainty. 1.2 Measurement: Make observations under condition X. In order to test hypotheses, we have to record what people have done under condition X. This is usually done by measuring some aspect of behaviour: choices, eye movement, reaction times, self-reports, ‚Ä¶ Remember that the assumption we just made is that people are rational. This means that they should pick the option with the highest possible reward. A simple test of rationality involves asking people to pick between options with different rewards. For example, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) presented people with scenarios varying in levels of risks and asked them to make choices. Before we look at two problems from their study, Now let us look at Problem 5 and Problem 6 from their study. Problem 5 is presented below with the 2 choice options. It had N=72 participants. Choice proportions are in parentheses. A: 50% chance to win a three-week tour of England, France, and Italy. (22%) B: A one-week tour of England, with certainty. (78%) So, 22% took a gamble on the long trip, while about 3.55 times as many people picked the certain outcome. Compare this result with Problem 6: C: 5% chance to win a three-week tour of England, France, and Italy. (67%) D: 10% chance to win a one-week tour of England. (33%) This is a sufficiently surprising result2 to make us reevaluate our assumption that people make rational choices. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) came up with Prospect Theory to explain both when people are rational and when they are not. 1.3 Test: Did we observe people do Y? If you look back at the results we just presented, it is simple enough to interpret. It gives a good and shallow overview of how you end up with some data. Unfortunately, it is often not this easy. Imagine a twist on this scenario, where you are interested in how people suffering from addiction weigh in possible losses and gains. We know that people suffering from substance-abuse disorders have a problem with reward processing (Gueguen, Schweitzer, and Konova 2021). So we can come up with a hypothesis that people suffering from substance-abuse disorder will be more likely to pick the worst option. If you want to measure it, you formulate new problems with two options, and test both healthy adults and adults suffering from substance-abuse. You collect your data and then look at the proportions of people picked one over the other in each group (healthy vs substance-abuse). In order to confirm or contradict our impromptu hypothesis, you are required to reliably conclude that the groups perform the same/different from the data (observations) you have. This is where data analysis (and R) comes in. References "],["why-statistics.html", "2 Why statistics? 2.1 Biases are unavoidable 2.2 Data has always more things to tell us", " 2 Why statistics?
